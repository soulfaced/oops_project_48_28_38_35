						<h1>OpenCV</h1>
						<h2 style="color:white">Object Oriented Programming Project</h2>
						<p>
							OpenCV stands for Open-Source Computer Vision (Library). It is the most common and popularly used, well-documented Computer Vision library. OpenCV is an open-source library that incorporates numerous computer vision algorithms. OpenCV increases computational efficiency and assists with real-time applications.

						<h2>Hand Detection using cv</h2>
						<p>
							Hand detection is a simple idea, but it requires some advanced tools to do it.
							In this hand detection we used mediapipe library which is provided by google and use it to create positions on hand and get coordinates on them.

						<h2>Rock Paper Scissor</h2>
						<p>
							By using hand detection we have created rock paper scissor game. to start we have to press 's' and computer will randomly put any one of them and we can compete with computer in the game.

							Car parking Space Checker
						</h2>
						<p>
							In this code we will have to load a video of parking lot and we can see how many spaces are aviable. it create blocks around parking spaces and give result according if its filled with car it will sow red and if it is vacant it will show green.

						<h2>
							Hand Sign Detection
						</h2>
						<p>
							This Project is used to recognise hand sign language by using Neural Network Model which was trained by using teachable machine. we trained the model for hand sign detection of "A" , "B" , and "C".
